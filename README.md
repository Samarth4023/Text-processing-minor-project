# Text Processing Minor Project üìù

Welcome to the **Text Processing and Information Application**! üöÄ As part of this project, I've leveraged object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to build a powerful tool for handling text data. Let's dive into what this application can do:

## Features:

1. **Read a Text File:**
   - Our application can read text files, extracting valuable information from them.

2. **Unique Word Count:**
   - We analyze the text and determine the number of unique words present. No more duplicate words slipping through the cracks!

3. **Total Word Count:**
   - Curious about the total word count? Our app has you covered. It counts all the words in the input text.

4. **Word Frequency Dictionary:**
   - We create a dictionary that contains the count of each word. This dictionary is then saved to a JSON file for easy access and sharing.

5. **Lowercase Conversion and Word Occurrence:**
   - All words are converted to lowercase to ensure consistency.
   - We also count the occurrence of each word (case-insensitive) and save this information to another JSON file.

6. **Whitespace Cleanup:**
   - Extra whitespace can be pesky. Our app removes any additional whitespace, ensuring clean and tidy text.

7. **Special Character Removal:**
   - Special characters cluttering your text? Fear not! We eliminate them, leaving only the essential content.

8. **Save Output:**
   - Finally, we save the processed output to a new text file, ready for further analysis or sharing.

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application.
3. Provide the path to your text file.
4. Explore the results!
